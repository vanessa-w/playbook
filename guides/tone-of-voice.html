          <h1>Tone of voice</h1>
          <h1 id="tone-of-voice">Tone of voice</h1>

<p>This is an overview of how we write and should apply to all the writing we do in
dxw. It’s an important part of how we present ourselves to the outside world,
alongside our new dxw brand. You can find the brand guidelines and all the
assets you need in our brand toolkit in the
<a href="https://dxw.slack.com/archives/C013ZEQ8XEW">#dxw-brand</a> Slack channel.</p>

<p>Our tone of voice is important because it will have a big influence on how
someone reading our content will feel.  This isn’t a set of rules as good
writing shouldn’t feel like a tick-box exercise.</p>

<p>We want people who work in the public and third sectors to benefit from our
approach and what we learn through working with them. So it’s important that
we’re as open and transparent as possible when we communicate. Even better if
that persuades others to follow our example.</p>

<p>We want our readers to feel that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they can trust us</li>
  <li>we care</li>
  <li>we have lots of experience</li>
  <li>we’re open and transparent about our work</li>
</ul>

<p>There’s lots of good practice guidance in these
<a href="https://readabilityguidelines.co.uk/">Readability Guidelines</a> by Content Design
London. To help with readability, it’s also a good idea to use something like
the <a href="http://www.hemingwayapp.com/">Hemingway app</a> which can help you improve
your writing. But remember it’s just a guide.</p>

<h2 id="overall-tone-of-voice">Overall tone of voice</h2>

<p>Our <a href="/#values">values</a> should guide how we do things, and how we communicate. 
So our writing should show dxw as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>helpful - we explain our work openly and clearly</li>
  <li>positive - with a focus on how we helped others and what we learned</li>
  <li>reliable - we don’t use superlatives but we show that we do consistently good

  <li>curious - and willing to try new things and improve. As well as helping others
to do the same</li>
  <li>determined - and motivated to tackle difficult things and have high standards</li>
</ul>

<p>We should aim to show our audience the value of our work, not just tell them
about it. That might mean showing things like screenshots or video footage of
services, outputs or pictures from user research sessions and so on.</p>

<h2 id="no-need-for-formality">No need for formality</h2>

<p>We work with organisations but we should write for the people who work in those
organisations or use their services. That means using the words that real people
use.</p>

<p>Think about what you’ve written and whether it’s something you would say out

  <li>swap “utilise” for “use”</li>
</ul>

<p>Always think about the most straightforward way of saying something. The
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style">GOV.UK style guide</a>
provides some helpful examples of words you might want to avoid.</p>

<p>Capitalise specific names for a person, place or thing, words at the beginning

<p>Your writing will be more readable if you use active sentences rather than

<h2 id="specific-names-and-technical-terms">Specific names and technical terms</h2>

<p>We use these names and technical terms quite a lot. So be sure to get them
right.</p>

<p><strong>Digital Marketplace</strong>: the government procurement website should be
capitalised as it is a proper noun to distinguish it from other digital
marketplaces (like eBay).</p>

<p><strong>dxw</strong>: in client-facing and public-facing documents, dxw should be lowercase.</p>

<p><strong>G-Cloud</strong>: never ‘G-cloud’ or ‘g-cloud’ or ‘G Cloud’ or ‘GCloud’.</p>

<p><strong>GovPress</strong>: not ‘Govpress’ or ‘Gov Press’</p>

<p><strong>multisite</strong>: if referring to the feature directly, “Multisite” should be
capitalised. If referring to a multisite WordPress setup, “multisite”. Never
“multi site” or “multi-site”.</p>
