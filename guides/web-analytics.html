provides a control you can compare against, and a backup in case you get the
filtering wrong on other views.
  Set up a “main” view that has Google’s “Bot filtering” activated (found under
Admin > View Settings). This should automatically remove the majority of spam
traffic.
  You may also want to
filter out
internal traffic on the main view (e.g. from within the dxw office, or
staging/localhost versions of the site). You can do this by IP (e.g. using
dxw’s external IP to filter out office traffic) or hostname (e.g. the staging
site URL to filter out staging traffic).
  To avoid double-counting page views that differ only by query string,
follow Google’s advice
to build a list of query parameters your site receives, then blacklist the
ones you don’t care about using the field in View Settings.
  Set up Google Search Console
(formerly Google Webmaster Tools), and give Analytics access under
Acquisition > Search Console. This will allow you to see the search queries
people are using that return the site in Google results.
Take some time to think about what activity on the site you might want to track.
If you do not record a user action at the time it happens, it is lost
forever, so the more you can set up in advance (e.g. goals for transactions
such as newsletter sign-ups, recording of on-site search terms), the better.">
