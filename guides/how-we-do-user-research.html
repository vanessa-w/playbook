and legal way. If your situation isn’t covered, and you’re not sure what to do,

        <li data-title="User research workflow" data-content="These are the things that user researchers usually do on projects.
  
    Support sales and scheduling

    Researchers contribute to client proposals and scheduling projects. We advise
on research activities to include in proposals, join in pitch presentations
and help with scheduling decisions.

    This helps dxw digital to win good work that delivers valuable results for
our clients, for users and for ourselves.
  
  
    Help setup the project and team

    Researchers get involved with project inception and planning. We review
existing evidence. And we create research plans that show what we’ll do, why
and how we’ll do it. We make sure the plan is achievable and allows us to do
research at a sustainable pace.

    This helps teams to focus on understanding and meeting the needs of users,
and to produce the best results with the people, time and resources we have.
  
  
    Recruit people for research

    Researchers recruit appropriate participants for research activities. Finding
the right participants at the right time is always challenging, so we start
recruiting as soon as we can and use a variety of approaches to reach
everyone we need. We keep track of who participates in our research, so we
can be confident that we’re including the right people.

    This helps teams to learn about all their users and produce services that
work well for everyone.

    How we get informed consent for user research
When and how we give incentives to research participants
  
  
    Plan and do research activities

    This is the most obvious and visible part of our work. We choose research
activities that provide strong evidence and reliable answers, for the least
time, effort and cost. And we choose activities that help our teams and
different kinds of users to participate.

    We record what we do and how we do it, for each other, and for those who come
after us.

    This helps teams to embed regular research into their agile practices and get
the best results from the effort they put in.

    How we write and use discussion guides
How we take notes and record research sessions
  
  
    Analyse research and produce findings

    Researchers carefully analyse the different kinds of data we collect. We
analyse data in batches and record our findings from sprint to sprint. And we
involve our colleagues and clients in analysis to make sure our findings are
clear and relevant.

    This helps teams understand, believe in and act quickly on what they learn.
  
  
    Help teams make good decisions

    Researchers produce findings and other recommendations that help teams make
good decisions about what to do next and how to approach it. We get actively
involved in identifying opportunities, creating design ideas and setting
priorities.

    This helps teams to create great services that work well for users, and to
strike a balance between short-term wins and more complex, long term changes.
  
  
    Create and share outputs

    Researchers create and share formal outputs like plans, presentations,
reports and diagrams. These record and communicate the important things we
learn. We create finished outputs from sprint to sprint, not just at the end
of a project. And we think carefully about how we present and share these
outputs to produce the most impact.

    This helps our clients and other stakeholders use and benefit from what we
learned both during the project and long after we’ve gone.
  
  
    Take care of research data

    Researchers know it’s important to manage research data carefully. We follow
our privacy policy and
ISO27001 certification when
collecting, processing and storing research data to make sure we comply with
that
General Data Protection Regulation.

    This helps teams to get the most from the research data they collect, while
protecting the privacy of the people taking part.

incentive given to their organisation or donated to charity.We do not expect to pay incentives to our clients‘ staff or to other public
servants who take part in research related to their work.When we are paying an incentive, make sure the participant knows the amount of
the incentive and how they will receive it. Include this in the information

have them
sign a receipt.For a remote research session, use the #dxw-purchasing Slack channel to ask for
the vouchers to be posted to the participant. Enclose the vouchers in a signed
thank you sheet.Handle the incentive at the start of the research session - either giving the
incentive, or confirming that the incentive will be sent. This avoids any
suggestion that participants have to ‘earn’ their incentive. It also means you
don’t have to deal with the incentive if you want to stop a problematic session.">

        <li data-title="Good practices to follow" data-content="
  
    Capture only what you need and have consent for

    Good user research practice, and good privacy practice, is to capture only
the data you believe you need. For example, don’t make a screen or video
recording, ‘just in case’, if you’ll only ever need a transcript of what the
participant says.

    Make sure that anything you capture during a session is covered by the
consent you’ve collected. If a participant changes their mind about what they
consent to, be prepared to not make, or to delete recordings you no longer
have consent for.
  
  
    Do not use your personal devices

    Always use a dxw provided device, rather than your personal device, when
taking notes and photos, or making recordings.

    Using our own devices in research means that personal data about research
participants can be mixed into our personal data stores, like cloud photo
libraries. And also runs the risk of participants, client staff and
colleagues seeing our personal messages and images.
  
  
    Keep your notes and recordings secure

    As soon as possible after the session, transfer any notes and recordings from
paper and other devices to your dxw provided laptop. And from your laptop to
the dxw Google Drive or to the client’s research store.

    Keep only anonymised notes, quotes and images in tools like Miro and Trello.
  
  
    Have a fall back

    The one certainty in user research is that things go wrong. So make sure you
have other options to capture what you need.

    For example:

    
      The participant may decide they don’t want to be recorded in a particular
way, so be prepared to switch from video to an audio-only recording, or to
just take notes
      Your preferred device, app or service may not be working properly, so have
an alternative like a paper notebook
      Your note taker, assistant or observer may not be able to join the session,
so be prepared to take notes and recordings yourself
    

    Note that if the participant refuses all recording, including note taking,
you may want to abandon the session.

          <h1>How we do user research</h1>
          <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This guide explains how we do user research at dxw digital.</p>

<p>The guidance applies to all user researchers employed by dxw digital, both staff
and contractors.</p>

<p>The guidance builds on our user research
<a href="/#user-research-principles">principles</a>. It also builds on the
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research">guidance for user research in the GDS Service Manual</a>
so we can help teams meet the Government
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard">Service Standard</a>.</p>

<p>Some of the guidance explains how to do user research in an effective, ethical
and legal way. If your situation isn’t covered, and you’re not sure what to do,
ask John Waterworth, the Head of User Research.</p>

<h2 id="user-research-workflow">User research workflow</h2>

<p>These are the things that user researchers usually do on projects.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Support sales and scheduling</strong></p>

    <p>Researchers contribute to client proposals and scheduling projects. We advise
on research activities to include in proposals, join in pitch presentations
and help with scheduling decisions.</p>

    <p>This helps dxw digital to win good work that delivers valuable results for
our clients, for users and for ourselves.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Help setup the project and team</strong></p>

    <p>Researchers get involved with project inception and planning. We review
existing evidence. And we create research plans that show what we’ll do, why
and how we’ll do it. We make sure the plan is achievable and allows us to do
research at a sustainable pace.</p>

    <p>This helps teams to focus on understanding and meeting the needs of users,
and to produce the best results with the people, time and resources we have.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Recruit people for research</strong></p>

    <p>Researchers recruit appropriate participants for research activities. Finding
the right participants at the right time is always challenging, so we start
recruiting as soon as we can and use a variety of approaches to reach
everyone we need. We keep track of who participates in our research, so we
can be confident that we’re including the right people.</p>

    <p>This helps teams to learn about all their users and produce services that
work well for everyone.</p>

<a href="#when-and-how-we-give-incentives-to-research-participants">When and how we give incentives to research participants</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Plan and do research activities</strong></p>

    <p>This is the most obvious and visible part of our work. We choose research
activities that provide strong evidence and reliable answers, for the least
time, effort and cost. And we choose activities that help our teams and
different kinds of users to participate.</p>

    <p>We record what we do and how we do it, for each other, and for those who come
after us.</p>

    <p>This helps teams to embed regular research into their agile practices and get
the best results from the effort they put in.</p>

<a href="#how-we-take-notes-and-record-research-sessions">How we take notes and record research sessions</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Analyse research and produce findings</strong></p>

    <p>Researchers carefully analyse the different kinds of data we collect. We
analyse data in batches and record our findings from sprint to sprint. And we
involve our colleagues and clients in analysis to make sure our findings are
clear and relevant.</p>

    <p>This helps teams understand, believe in and act quickly on what they learn.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Help teams make good decisions</strong></p>

    <p>Researchers produce findings and other recommendations that help teams make
good decisions about what to do next and how to approach it. We get actively
involved in identifying opportunities, creating design ideas and setting
priorities.</p>

    <p>This helps teams to create great services that work well for users, and to
strike a balance between short-term wins and more complex, long term changes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Create and share outputs</strong></p>

    <p>Researchers create and share formal outputs like plans, presentations,
reports and diagrams. These record and communicate the important things we
learn. We create finished outputs from sprint to sprint, not just at the end
of a project. And we think carefully about how we present and share these
outputs to produce the most impact.</p>

    <p>This helps our clients and other stakeholders use and benefit from what we
learned both during the project and long after we’ve gone.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Take care of research data</strong></p>

    <p>Researchers know it’s important to manage research data carefully. We follow
our <a href="https://www.dxw.com/privacy-statement/">privacy policy</a> and
<a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/iso27001">ISO27001 certification</a> when
collecting, processing and storing research data to make sure we comply with
that
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation">General Data Protection Regulation</a>.</p>

    <p>This helps teams to get the most from the research data they collect, while
protecting the privacy of the people taking part.</p>

    <p><a href="#how-we-take-notes-and-record-research-sessions">How we take notes and record research sessions</a></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="how-we-name-and-identify-documents">How we name and identify documents</h2>

<p>It’s important that team members and stakeholders know they have the right
research plan, discussion guide or other research document.</p>

<p>So we give our documents consistent file names like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>YYYY MM DD - TYPE - CLIENT - PROJECT - RESEARCH ACTIVITY (if needed for
clarity)</li>
  <li>For example, 2019 10 01 - User research plan - Southwark - Affordable homes
monitoring alpha</li>
</ul>

<p>And a consistent front cover with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Client and dxw logos</li>
  <li>Client and project names</li>
  <li>Document type</li>
  <li>Date</li>
  <li>Main contact (who wrote it)</li>
</ul>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Southwark Council</li>
  <li>Affordable homes monitoring alpha</li>
  <li>User research plan</li>
  <li>(Draft)</li>
  <li>1 October 2019</li>
  <li>John Waterworth</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-we-write-and-use-discussion-guides">How we write and use discussion guides</h2>

<p>We create discussion guides to help us plan and do research activities, like
interviews, visits, workshops and usability tests.</p>

<p>They help us to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identify the purpose of the research activity and what we want to get from it</li>
  <li>review planned activities with team members and stakeholders so we stay
aligned with project goals</li>
  <li>stay on track during research sessions</li>
  <li>make sure different researchers cover the same topics so participants have a
consistent experience</li>
  <li>keep a record of what we did in each research activity</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-parts-of-a-discussion-guide">The parts of a discussion guide</h3>

<h4 id="introduction-1">Introduction</h4>

<p>Recap the goals of the project and the research activity, describe the methods
you’ll be using, and set out the overall structure of the research session.</p>

<h4 id="preparation">Preparation</h4>

<p>Describe anything the researcher needs to have or do, to prepare for the
session. Reference things like the information sheet to send to participants,
describe how to set up the prototype you’ll be testing, and reference the
<a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MAUax08jwwqNd1BWfH-gixSbltY2qE-m">notes template</a>
you want to use.</p>

<h4 id="welcome">Welcome</h4>

<p>Set out the things you’ll say to the participant to let them them know what’s
going on and make sure they feel comfortable. It can be helpful to write this
out word for word, so you have something to fall back on when you’re tired, or
get interrupted or distracted.</p>

<p>In your welcome you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Say thank you</strong> - Start off by letting the participant know you appreciate
them offering their time (incentivised or not)</li>
  <li><strong>Introduce yourself</strong> - Let them know your name, role, company and who you
are working for</li>
  <li><strong>State your relationship to the client</strong> - We are <strong>independent
researchers</strong>, working on behalf of a client</li>
  <li><strong>Summarise the research purpose</strong> - Explain what you’re trying to find out,
eg We’re interested in how you recruit teachers for your school</li>
  <li><strong>Remind them it is voluntary</strong> - They can choose to stop at any time</li>
  <li><strong>Reassure tham that there are no right or wrong answers</strong> - We’re interested
in how the participant thinks and what influences that</li>
  <li><strong>Ask them to be honest</strong> - As researchers we won’t be offended by any
comments, we just want to find out what people really think about a service
and how it might be improved</li>
  <li><strong>Describe how the session will go</strong> - Let the participant know who is taking
notes or observing, how you are recording the session, how long the session
will take, and what you’ll be doing in that time, so the participant knows
what to expect</li>
  <li><strong>Check consent and non-disclosure</strong> - Has this been done? Do they have any
questions?</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="topics-tasks-and-activities">Topics, tasks and activities</h4>

<p>Have a section in your guide for each of the main interview topics, test tasks
or workshop activities.</p>

<p>For each one write out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What you are trying to learn</li>
  <li>For an interview topic, the starter questions you’ll ask along with likely
follow ups</li>
  <li>For a test task or workshop activity
    <ul>
      <li>the steps to do</li>
      <li>explanations and instructions for participants, such asking them to think
out loud during a test so you can understand what’s happening</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>How long the topic, task or activity is likely to take</li>
  <li>The priority - is this essential, or could you leave it out if you’re short of
time</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="wrap-up">Wrap up</h4>

<p>Describe how the researcher should conclude the session with the participant.
This can include asking the participant for their final thoughts, asking them
how the session went for them, letting them know what will happen next, and
thanking them for their time.</p>

<p>Also include any steps for the researcher, like collecting and storing
recordings, or deleting data from prototypes.</p>

<h3 id="three-discussion-guide-templates">Three discussion guide templates</h3>

<p>We have template discussion guides for three different kinds of research
activities:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1XeBhmQL0jqFFsl2Cw-DOKVpabTRILGl-TjeyUDW90vM">Interviews and contextual research</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1hcVkLGJVDB9ZOoMIz93erUpk1RUgXN_ZcZflJxsFpHw">Usability tests</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ZHZwLBnUlDsxrvv1qj_ZpFU9QGsP_dIDLMVcGbEYswY">Workshops</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-we-get-informed-consent-for-user-research">How we get informed consent for user research</h2>

<p>You must have informed consent from participants before you start any research
activity with them. And you must then act only within the consent the
participant has given.</p>

<p>This guidance explains how we collect and keep evidence of informed consent at
dxw digital. It builds on the general guidance on
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/getting-users-consent-for-research">getting informed consent</a>
in the Service Manual.</p>

<h3 id="creating-consent-materials">Creating consent materials</h3>

<h4 id="using-dxw-digital-or-client-consent-materials">Using dxw digital or client consent materials</h4>

<p>There are two basic options:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The simplest and best option is to use our client’s existing consent
materials. If they don’t have any, we can work with the client to create
consent materials for the project, that the client can then reuse in future.</p>

    <p>In this case the client will manage all the research data we collect and keep
the associated records of consent.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If using the client’s consent materials is not possible, or if the client
asks us to do confidential research, we can use the dxw digital
<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=19lm5_gzzqzVP0NnNZZiqPhEwW2_i2bkI5apAaie4-4M">information sheet</a>
and
<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ilYXwrrkl9s4jMRkJm3uCWAON6bnEeYinKvPd-VOz8k">consent form</a>
templates.</p>

    <p>In this case dxw will manage the research data and keep the associated
records of consent.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Which ever approach you take, make sure your consent materials and process
follow the
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/getting-users-consent-for-research#what-informed-consent-is">good practice for informed consent</a>
described in the Service Manual.</p>

<h4 id="creating-an-information-sheet">Creating an information sheet</h4>

<p>For each round or batch of research you do, you should create a specific
information sheet that describes the research you are doing, and gives the
participant the information they need.</p>

<p>You can use the same information sheet for several rounds or batches of
research, as long as you are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>doing the research for the same purpose</li>
  <li>doing the same things during the sessions</li>
  <li>collecting the same research data</li>
  <li>working with the same third-party organisations and suppliers</li>
</ul>

<p>We have
<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=19lm5_gzzqzVP0NnNZZiqPhEwW2_i2bkI5apAaie4-4M">template information sheets</a>
to use for the most common research situations.</p>

<h4 id="creating-a-consent-form">Creating a consent form</h4>

<p>If you are using a client’s consent form, make sure it clearly describes dxw
digital’s involvement in the research, and how we will share research data and
findings.</p>

<p>We have
<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ilYXwrrkl9s4jMRkJm3uCWAON6bnEeYinKvPd-VOz8k">template consent forms</a>
for the most common research situations.</p>

<p>If none of the standard consent forms will work for the research activities you
are doing, speak to the Head of User Research.</p>

<h3 id="sharing-your-consent-materials-and-process">Sharing your consent materials and process</h3>

<p>Some clients and stakeholders will not understand the ethical and legal reasons
for getting informed consent, and will not be familiar with good consent
practice.</p>

<p>To avoid problems later, share your consent materials and process as soon as you
can with the client and with any organisations whose staff or members you are
researching with.</p>

<h3 id="collecting-consent">Collecting consent</h3>

<h4 id="providing-the-information-sheet">Providing the information sheet</h4>

<p>Give each participant a copy of the information sheet when they are being
recruited for a research session. Check which format and channel works best for
them - email attachment, paper letter, easy read, etc.</p>

<p>For a face to face research session, make sure you can provide a paper copy of
both the information sheet and the associated privacy statement/privacy policy,
if a participant asks for one.</p>

<h4 id="face-to-face-research-sessions">Face to face research sessions</h4>

<p>For user research sessions where you meet the participant in person, you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>give the participant a printed copy of the consent form</li>
  <li>send the consent form in an accessible digital format the participant can read
using their assistive technology</li>
  <li>read the consent form aloud</li>
</ul>

<p>Check with the participant which format works best for them.</p>

<p>Give the participant the consent form as soon as you can. Make sure they have
time to read it carefully, and an opportunity to ask questions, before you ask
the participant to sign .</p>

<h4 id="remote-or-telephone-research-sessions">Remote or telephone research sessions</h4>

<p>For user research sessions where you will not meet the participant face to face,
you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>attach the consent form to an email in an accessible digital format</li>
  <li>send a paper consent form in the post</li>
</ul>

<p>Ask the participant to send a reply, confirming their consent. They can reply to
the email, or post back a signed paper consent form.</p>

<h4 id="during-the-session">During the session</h4>

<p>At the start of the session, remind the participant that their participation is
voluntary and they can stop or take a break at any time. Remind the participant
about the different ways you are recording the session, and about anyone
observing or listening in. Ask the participant to confirm their consent for the
recording.</p>

<p>As the session continues, actively make sure you have the participant’s consent.
For example, check in with the participant if they look concerned about an
activity, or if you’re on a visit and want to take a photo in a new area.</p>

<h3 id="keeping-a-record-of-consent">Keeping a record of consent</h3>

<p>For paper consent forms, scan or photograph the signed consent form and keep the
image file in the folder with the research data you collect in the session.</p>

<p>For email responses, keep a copy of the consent form and of the participant’s
reply in the folder with the research data you collect in the session.</p>

<p>Make sure the consent form, email reply and any research data have the same
participant identifier. Do not include participant names or other personal
identifiers in the document names.</p>

<h2 id="when-and-how-we-give-incentives-to-research-participants">When and how we give incentives to research participants</h2>

<p>It‘s normal to pay members of the public an incentive when they take part in
research activities with us.</p>

<p>This guidance explains how we agree incentives with clients and pay incentives
to participants.</p>

<p>It builds on the
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/find-user-research-participants#giving-incentives">basic guidance on giving incentives</a>
in the Service Manual.</p>

<h3 id="who-gets-incentives">Who gets incentives</h3>

<p>We will normally pay incentives to members of the public, including people who
use a government service for their work. Professionals and members of groups may
not be comfortable with getting an incentive themselves, and may want the
incentive given to their organisation or donated to charity.</p>

<p>We do not expect to pay incentives to our clients‘ staff or to other public
servants who take part in research related to their work.</p>

<p>When we are paying an incentive, make sure the participant knows the amount of
the incentive and how they will receive it. Include this in the <a href="link to consent guidance">information
sheet</a>.</p>

<h3 id="agreeing-incentives">Agreeing incentives</h3>

<p>It’s best to include estimates of incentives and other research expenses in the
statement of work.</p>

<p>You can then confirm the exact incentive with the client when you are planning a
batch of research.</p>

<p>On previous project we have paid:</p>

<ul>
  <li>£30 of Love2Shop vouchers for 1.5 hours of in-person usability testing</li>
  <li>£50 cash for geographically-specific users to take part in 1 hour of remote
mobile usability testing</li>
  <li>£100 cash for an hour-long discovery research session with people likely to
need assisted digital support</li>
  <li>£100 cash for 45 minute research session with small businesses</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="paying-incentives-through-a-recruitment-agency">Paying incentives through a recruitment agency</h3>

<p>If you are using a recruitment agency, ask them to pay the incentive to the
participant. They will know how they do this. They may charge a small fee for
handling the incentive.</p>

<p>If a participant contacts dxw digital to say they haven’t received their
incentive, apologise and contact the agency to let them know.</p>

<h3 id="paying-incentives-using-shopping-vouchers">Paying incentives using shopping vouchers</h3>

<p>Where we are paying the incentive, we use shopping vouchers. Normally from
<a href="https://www.highstreetvouchers.com/gifts/love2shop-gift-vouchers">Love2shop</a>.</p>

<p>Request the amount of vouchers you need through the #dxw-purchasing Slack
channel. They should be in £5 and £10 denominations so they are easier to spend.</p>

<p>In a face-to-face research session, give the vouchers to the participant and
have them
<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-O9Qvp4kgs4t0JfQTIQF9dkiexv5mZtPNJfcxtmODZ0">sign a receipt</a>.</p>

<p>For a remote research session, use the #dxw-purchasing Slack channel to ask for
the vouchers to be posted to the participant. Enclose the vouchers in a signed
<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=142Sf1QYH9wcySPf6GIOskv5qyJlc9phGZSeoCsxCoeU">thank you sheet</a>.</p>

<p>Handle the incentive at the start of the research session - either giving the
incentive, or confirming that the incentive will be sent. This avoids any
suggestion that participants have to ‘earn’ their incentive. It also means you
don’t have to deal with the incentive if you want to stop a problematic session.</p>

<h3 id="other-ways-to-pay-incentives">Other ways to pay incentives</h3>

<p>Other options for paying incentives might be a donation to a preferred charity,
or a hamper that can be shared with a team.</p>

<h3 id="withholding-incentives">Withholding incentives</h3>

<p>We do not pay the incentive (or any recruitment fee) if the participant doesn’t
show up for their session. Although we might still pay the incentive if the
participant tries to attend, but is stopped by an emergency or severe travel
problem beyond their control.</p>

<p>If a recruitment agency provides a participant who does not match the brief, we
will pay the participant their incentive, but we will not pay the agency their
recruitment fee.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-take-notes-and-record-research-sessions">How we take notes and record research sessions</h2>

<p>To capture what happens in our research sessions we take notes and photos, make
audio, video and screen recordings, and take copies of paperwork and other
material that participants use or refer to.</p>

<p>We use these notes, photos and recordings during analysis to make sure we
produce valid findings. And we use extracted quotes, images and clips to
illustrate the findings we share.</p>

<p>There is good guidance on
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/taking-notes-and-recording-user-research-sessions">Taking notes and recording user research sessions</a>
in the Service Manual, and on
<a href="https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2012/04/capturing-user-research.php">Capturing User Research</a>
in UX Matters.</p>

<p>Here we provide additional, specific guidance for researchers at dxw.</p>

<h3 id="good-practices-to-follow">Good practices to follow</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Capture only what you need and have consent for</strong></p>

    <p>Good user research practice, and good privacy practice, is to capture only
the data you believe you need. For example, don’t make a screen or video
recording, ‘just in case’, if you’ll only ever need a transcript of what the
participant says.</p>

    <p>Make sure that anything you capture during a session is covered by the
consent you’ve collected. If a participant changes their mind about what they
consent to, be prepared to not make, or to delete recordings you no longer
have consent for.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Do not use your personal devices</strong></p>

    <p>Always use a dxw provided device, rather than your personal device, when
taking notes and photos, or making recordings.</p>

    <p>Using our own devices in research means that personal data about research
participants can be mixed into our personal data stores, like cloud photo
libraries. And also runs the risk of participants, client staff and
colleagues seeing our personal messages and images.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Keep your notes and recordings secure</strong></p>

    <p>As soon as possible after the session, transfer any notes and recordings from
paper and other devices to your dxw provided laptop. And from your laptop to
the dxw Google Drive or to the client’s research store.</p>

    <p>Keep only anonymised notes, quotes and images in tools like Miro and Trello.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Have a fall back</strong></p>

    <p>The one certainty in user research is that things go wrong. So make sure you
have other options to capture what you need.</p>

    <p>For example:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The participant may decide they don’t want to be recorded in a particular
way, so be prepared to switch from video to an audio-only recording, or to
just take notes</li>
      <li>Your preferred device, app or service may not be working properly, so have
an alternative like a paper notebook</li>
      <li>Your note taker, assistant or observer may not be able to join the session,
so be prepared to take notes and recordings yourself</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Note that if the participant refuses all recording, including note taking,
you may want to abandon the session.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="using-your-dxw-provided-laptop">Using your dxw provided laptop</h3>

<p>Whenever possible, use your dxw provided laptop for taking notes and making
recordings. Our laptops have encrypted drives and we follow good security
policies.</p>

<p>With your laptop you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>capture notes to a local file or a Google Sheet</li>
  <li>record audio using a microphone and the Voice Memos or Quicktime apps</li>
  <li>record video using an external camera and Quicktime</li>
  <li>record your laptop screen using Quicktime or Screenshot</li>
</ul>

<p>If research participants might use your laptop or see your screen during a
research session, it’s a good idea to create a separate ‘research’ user account
on your laptop with things like notifications and browser autofill turned off.</p>

<h3 id="using-a-dxw-provided-handheld-device">Using a dxw provided handheld device</h3>

<p>Use a dxw provided handheld device, rather than own phone or tablet, to take
photos and short videos during interviews, visits and workshops.</p>

<p>Remember to delete the photos and recordings from the device once you have
transfered them to your laptop or to Google Drive.</p>

<h3 id="using-the-notes-template">Using the notes template</h3>

<p>We have a
<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1r6xtVgHBFTDxbFGSqk3wXFDy_5JDwkBpGBHibnLKuwM">template for a Google Sheet</a>
you can use to take notes during a research session.</p>

<p>You can make a copy of the sheet for each research session, or make a copy for
each batch of research and create tabs within the sheet for each research
session.</p>

<h3 id="using-sticky-notes-and-paper-worksheets">Using sticky notes and paper worksheets</h3>

<p>We often use sticky notes and paper worksheets to capture information during
research sessions, for example when
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/researching-user-experiences">researching users’ experiences</a>.</p>

<p>Design paper worksheets, and give people advice on
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/taking-notes-and-recording-user-research-sessions#using-sticky-notes">writing sticky notes</a>,
so you can easily use the information recorded.</p>

<p>Avoid capturing personally identifiable information about participants on sticky
notes or paper. If you capture any sensitive informaton on sticky notes or
paper, make sure to use a shredder to dispose of it.</p>

<p>Use a dxw provided phone or tablet, rather than your personal device, to capture
the contents of sticky notes and paper worksheets.</p>

<h3 id="using-a-video-conferencing-service">Using a video conferencing service</h3>

<p>Our preferred service for recording remote screen sharing sessions is
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KiaXHr-VCX8T6K9YWPnmHHiAChJda_gH4av03N4pDrg/">GoToMeeting</a>.
Setup GoToMeeting so that the recorded video is saved onto your dxw provided
laptop. And then transfer the video to Google Drive as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Depending on the client, we may need to use their preferred video conferencing
service. If the service stores recordings ‘in the cloud’, make sure to download
the video as soon as possible and delete it from the service.</p>

<h3 id="using-third-party-facilities">Using third-party facilities</h3>

<p>If you are using a third party facility like a usability lab, transfer any
recordings made by the lab to your dxw provided laptop as soon as possible after
the sessions are complete.</p>
