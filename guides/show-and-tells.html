why it’s important and how well it is going. It is often useful to recap some or
all of the following:
  What are the project goals?
  Who is in the team?
  How we work (agile, in sprints, multidisciplinary)
  What did we achieve in the last sprint?
  What has been the goal for this sprint? Why was this important?
A common approach is to organise the presentation into themes/sections based on
the epics you’ve dealt with during the sprint. The main thing is to tell a story
with a logical flow that explains how decisions were made or identified
recommendations.You can talk about challenges and things that haven’t gone so well, but be
mindful of the client and the environment in which the project is. Sometimes a
project retrospective can be a better place to unpick these things.">

screen work and can people dial in? If you need them, dxw have microphones and
cameras that you can use.
  Make sure you can record the session - we normally record and share them via
YouTube.
During your presentation make sure that you:
  Introduce the team (get each person who’s speaking to introduce themselves,
including their role)
  Show the work (demos, videos) where possible. Seeing an actual thing is more
powerful than a screenshot.
  Leave time for questions and feedback. Capture things that people raise that
you want to revisit later on.
  Avoid jargon and explain technical terms. Your audience might not know much
about the project or about how we work. It’s important to provide your
audience with context.
  Avoid just giving a detailed itemised list of everything that’s happened in
the last 2 weeks.
  Check in with remote participants to ensure that they can hear and are able to
follow the discussion.
