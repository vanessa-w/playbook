  Write each question on a separate sheet of paper or at the top of a piece of

  Stick them up on a wall so that everyone can see them.
For each question sheet:
  Ask the question to get a discussion started.
  Write bullet points on the appropriate sheet or on sticky notes to summarise
what people say.
  Ask follow up questions to clarify what you hear and to make sure you include
everyone’s thoughts.
  Ask about priority and scope. What’s essential? And what’s out of scope?
  You can facilitate this on your own, but the first few times you might want
to have a separate moderator and scribe. And it always helps to have another
colleague in the crowd who is focussed on listening and picking up on
anything you miss.
It’s best to put all the questions up together. The things people say in the
discussion will often relate to more than one question – for example, people
often mention outcomes for the organisation when they talk about why we’re doing
the work. With all the sheets up you can add bullet points to the appropriate
sheet.This method works well for groups up to 10 and typically takes 90 minutes to 2
hours.">

          <h1>Running a discovery kick-off workshop</h1>
          <p>This guide explains how we run a kick-off workshop for a discovery project at
dxw digital.</p>

<p>For an alpha or beta, or for a significant update to a live service, we run a
<a href="/guides/running-a-roadmapping-workshop">roadmapping workshop</a>.</p>

<p>For discovery focussed projects it can be less clear what the end result will
be, and whether we’re looking at a single service or cutting across several. So
we use a broader set of questions.</p>

<p>These are based on the
<a href="https://www.hollidazed.co.uk/2015/07/28/frame-the-problem">questions to frame a problem</a>
that <a href="https://twitter.com/BenHolliday">Ben Holiday</a> wrote about, the
<a href="https://www.myddelton.co.uk/blog/setting-up-a-discovery">discovery inception categories</a>
that <a href="https://twitter.com/myddelton">Will Myddelton</a> described, along with some
of the roadmapping questions.</p>
