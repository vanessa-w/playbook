It is not important that a story be implemented exactly how you would have done
it. Only that it meets the criteria above. When we find problems, we give
feedback to the developer who implemented the story, not fix things ourselves
inline with our principle of ‘Own your code’.It’s also important that code reviews have a constructive, amicable tone. To
this end, we bear in mind the

something to retroactively add to existing projects. When working on existing
projects or joining a project, make sure to follow the code style that is
already in place.While it can be tempting to write a new style guide, it’s not a worthwhile
investment of time. It’s important that a consistent style is adopted, but
mostly unimportant which specific style it is. So rather than having our own, we
have chosen the following existing style guides for our work:

into the release process for the project. This also means
versioning the project.If the team decides that a changelog is not appropriate for a project, you
should document that decision as an
Architectural Decision Record (ADR), so future
maintainers and contributors understand the reasoning for not doing so.See
Tech Team RFC-019

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<h3 id="development-principles">Development principles</h3>

<p>As part of regular retrospectives we evolve our principles by identifying what
works well. When we try something that helps with a particular pattern of
problem the team can acknowledge the benefits it brings and introduce it as a
principle.</p>

<h4 id="communicate-frequently">Communicate frequently</h4>

<ul>
  <li>space to learn from each other</li>
  <li>make shared decisions</li>
  <li>prevent duplication</li>
  <li>solve problems quicker</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="two-pairs-of-eyes">Two pairs of eyes</h4>

<p>All code we write needs be reviewed by another developer. We hope that doing
this will mean we:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ship better quality code</li>
  <li>get the opportunity to learn new skills</li>
  <li>increase the shared knowledge of our products</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="everything-is-tracked">Everything is tracked</h4>

<p>All code we write is represented in Trello (or another ticketing system as
required by the client) so that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the client can easily visualise how we’re doing and what needs their attention</li>
  <li>the team can see and react to bottle necks</li>
  <li>delivery managers can see what cards have been lingering</li>
  <li>developers can be confident what they are deploying</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="own-your-code">Own your code</h4>

<p>Having the opportunity to see a piece of work through to completion is a great
way to for developers to grow. To encourage this we ask reviewers to leave their
feedback, ask questions and discuss the code but not to make any changes without
the okay from the author. This will hopefully allow us to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>learn from our mistakes</li>
  <li>create personal achievements from seeing work through to production</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="do-the-smallest-amount-of-good-work">Do the smallest amount of good work</h4>

<p>We aspire to regularly ship
<a href="https://robots.thoughtbot.com/what-is-good-code">good code</a> and deliver it to
the users as often as possible. Doing so efficiently requires a balanced
approach to development.</p>

<p>Good signs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the code is easy to read and understand</li>
  <li>the code didn’t take too long to write</li>
  <li>the code is relatively easy to change</li>
</ul>

<p>Bad signs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>spending too much time over engineering (gold plating) our code</li>
  <li>delivering too quickly at the cost of any code quality</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="the-twenty-minute-rules">The twenty-minute rules</h4>

<ol>
  <li>being helpful is one of our values and this extends to development. If after
spending 20 minutes on a problem you haven’t made progress, invoke the
twenty-minute rule with another developer and get their advice</li>
  <li>discussions that go on for twenty-minutes or more can be a time sink. If an
agreement on how to progress cannot be found after 20 minutes, mentioning
this rule provides a pre-agreed way to acknowledge the problem and get to a
resolution as quickly as possible. Rate your concern for the issue out of 10
and a next step should naturally emerge</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-lifecycle-of-a-story">The lifecycle of a story</h2>

<p>Different projects have small variations to this process, but here are some
general guidelines.</p>

<h3 id="start-work-on-a-new-story">Start work on a new story</h3>

<ol>
  <li>assign yourself to the Trello card</li>
  <li>move the card to Trello’s ‘In progress’ column</li>

  </li>
  <li>create a <a href="#pull-requests">pull request</a> into the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">develop</code> branch</li>

        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="working-on-a-support-ticket">Working on a support ticket</h2>

<p>Support tickets can fall into two types of work flow depending on their
severity.</p>

<p>Most commonly tickets will simply fall into the same
<a href="#the-lifecycle-of-a-story">story process</a>, where fixes will go through
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">develop</code> and Staging for review and acceptance.</p>

<p>They can however be sometimes when there’s an emergency which requires a change
to production ASAP. This is when we reach for a <a href="#hotfix">hotfix</a>.</p>

<h3 id="hotfix">Hotfix</h3>

<p>We think of hotfixes in the same way as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotfix">Wikipedia</a> describes them:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>a hotfix implies that the change may have been made quickly and outside normal
development and testing processes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and also</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A hotfix is a change deemed critical enough that it cannot be held off until a
regular content patch.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An emergency for instance would be when:</p>

<ol>
  <li>production is unusable - users are directly affected</li>
  <li>a serious vulnerability has been discovered and is currently exploitable</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="issue-a-hotfix">Issue a hotfix</h4>

<p>When the decision to make a hotfix is made it’s important to communicate well.
Involve the rest of the team at this point and discuss the plan of action,
allowing delivery managers to communicate back to the client.</p>

<p>This is the only time a branch should be based off of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code> instead of
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">develop</code>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>create a new card in Trello and move it to ‘In progress’</li>
  <li>
    <p>create a new branch off of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code></p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git checkout -b &lt;branch-name&gt; origin/master
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li><a href="#committing">commit</a> the fix</li>
  <li>make a <a href="#pull-requests">pull request</a> into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code></li>
  <li>move the Trello card into ‘Awaiting review’</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="review-and-deploy-a-hotfix">Review and deploy a hotfix</h4>

<ol>
  <li>review the code</li>
  <li>check the fix has been tested locally if possible</li>
  <li>merge the pull request</li>
  <li>
    <p>manually merge the pull request back into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">develop</code></p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git checkout develop
git pull
git merge origin/master
git push
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>move the card on Trello into ‘Deployed to production’</li>
  <li>update the <a href="#tracking-changes">changelog</a></li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h2 id="deploying">Deploying</h2>

<p>Our approach is one of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery">continuous delivery</a> meaning
we build, test and deploy as frequently as possible.</p>

<p>We do this by using services such as Chef, TravisCI or GitHub Actions which are
configured to listen for Git pushes and then initiate the correct deployment.</p>

<h3 id="staging">Staging</h3>

<p>Staging deployments are automatic and should be initiated when each pull request
is merged. When you click merge the changes are immediately deployed to the
Staging environment.</p>

<p>Remember to move the card(s) along on Trello.</p>

<h3 id="production">Production</h3>

<p>Production deployments are done by manually merging <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">develop</code> into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code>.
Since everything on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">develop</code> has been through a pull request with CI tests, we
can be confident in the quality and stability.</p>

<p>To deploy:</p>

<ol>
  <li>review what work is currently awaiting deployment by looking at Trello, if
there are any unaccepted stories then you should hold off</li>
  <li>update the <a href="#tracking-changes">changelog</a></li>
  <li>
    <p>let the team know you’re deploying to Production</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git fetch
git checkout master
git pull
git merge origin/develop
git push
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>verify the deployment has been successful</li>
  <li>tag the merge commit with the version matching the
<a href="#tracking-changes">changelog</a></li>
  <li>update Trello with all the cards that have now been deployed</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h2 id="branching">Branching</h2>

<h3 id="how-to-make-a-branch">How to make a branch</h3>

<p>Create the branch off of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">develop</code>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git fetch
git checkout develop
git branch &lt;branch-name&gt;
git checkout &lt;branch-name&gt;

# or the shorthand

git checkout -b &lt;branch-name&gt; origin/develop
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="naming-the-branch">Naming the branch</h4>

<p>Having a convention allows for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all branches connected to a story or ticket are easily connected now and in
the future</li>
  <li>others can easily identify the intent of the contents without having to
interpret a commit’s title</li>
  <li>encourages small and concise commits which keeps the focus on the type of
change being made. If you are adding a new feature and fix something along the
way, that <em>should</em> be 2 commits instead of 1</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="convention">Convention</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Feature</p>

    <p>A branch that adds a new feature, as defined by the specified story</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fix</p>

    <p>A branch that corrects a problem in a feature already merged into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">develop</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Chore</p>

    <p>Chore branches are used for routine tasks for maintaining the application like
package upgrades, they don’t provide a new feature or fix an existing one</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hotfix</p>

    <p>A branch that adds an urgent fix to a problem that affects production. These
branches are based on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code> and do not go via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">develop</code>, so must be also be
merged into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">develop</code> when deployed</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>feature/{STORY ID}-{CONCISE TITLE}
fix/{STORY/TICKET ID}-{CONCISE TITLE}
chore/{STORY ID}-{CONCISE TITLE}
hotfix/{TICKET ID}-{CONCISE TITLE}
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="examples">Examples</h4>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>feature/523797477-add-logging-to-registration
fix/423797477-logging-happens-in-both-environments
chore/1934729239-reduce-caching-for-contact-details
hotfix/253947623-remove-breaking-change-to-repair-creation
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="update-your-branch-with-the-latest-changes-on-develop-rebasing">Update your branch with the latest changes on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">develop</code> (rebasing)</h3>

<p>When working in a team, other pull requests will often get merged in before
yours is finished. It’s important to make sure you’re developing against the
latest version of the code base as much as possible.</p>

<p>You can do this by rebasing your work on top of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">develop</code> branch.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git checkout &lt;branch-name&gt;
git rebase origin/develop
git push --force-with-lease
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>During the rebase there may be conflicts which should be resolved at that point.
If in doubt talk to the other developer who you’re conflicting with and reason
out what the correct state should be.</p>

<p>Force pushing in this situation is the only time it should be necessary, adding
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--force-with-lease</code> ensures you don’t accidentally overwrite someone else’s
additions.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="committing">Committing</h2>

<p>Taking the time to write good commits is as valuable as writing good code. They
record the story of each project, line by line, which makes it possible to
understand now and in the future.</p>

<p>Ask yourself these questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>what is the <strong>new</strong> behaviour of the application?</li>
  <li>have I written down <strong>why</strong> I chose this approach over the others?</li>
  <li>are there relevant links I could include to help the next person?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="examples-1">Examples</h3>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># Poor
Added repairs

# Great
Job postings are now displayed on the landing page

- Getting the Job postings out of the external API proved difficult but I think
  the solution we have will allow us to easily upgrade to the new release they

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># Poor

- As a short term workaround until the bug is fixed I am stripping out any of
  these characters if they are present.
</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># Poor

</code></pre></div></div>

<hr />

<h2 id="code-review">Code review</h2>

<p>We believe that code reviews are important. They help us to learn from each
other, to maintain consistency in the code we write, and to ensure we push
well-reasoned and bug-free code to Production. When performing a code review, we
make sure that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>we cannot see any code that could give rise to a security vulnerability</li>
  <li>the story has been implemented clearly and maintainably</li>
  <li>the code contains well-written commits that help us to understand the changes</li>
  <li>the code follows code style guides</li>
  <li>the <a href="#tracking-changes">changelog</a> has been updated is the change was
significant</li>
</ul>

<p>It is not important that a story be implemented exactly how you would have done
it. Only that it meets the criteria above. When we find problems, we give
feedback to the developer who implemented the story, not fix things ourselves
inline with our principle of <a href="#own-your-code">‘Own your code’</a>.</p>

<p>It’s also important that code reviews have a constructive, amicable tone. To
this end, we bear in mind the
<a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/master/code-review">Thoughtbot</a> code
review guide, which contains good rules for keeping things positive and useful.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="code-style">Code style</h2>

<p>We write our code in a consistent way to ensure it is well-structured and easy
to follow for the rest of the team. Similar to the guidelines laid out in
<a href="https://playbook.thoughtbot.com/#style-guide">Thoughtbot’s style guide</a>,
approach this guidance as a way to code on present and future projects, not
something to retroactively add to existing projects. When working on existing
projects or joining a project, make sure to follow the code style that is
already in place.</p>

<p>While it can be tempting to write a new style guide, it’s not a worthwhile
investment of time. It’s important that a consistent style is adopted, but
mostly unimportant which specific style it is. So rather than having our own, we
have chosen the following existing style guides for our work:</p>

<ul>
  <li>PHP -
<a href="https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md">PSR-2</a></li>
  <li>Ruby -
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide">Ruby community style guide</a></li>
  <li>Sass -
<a href="https://sass-guidelin.es/#syntax--formatting">Sass Guidelines - Syntax and formatting</a></li>
  <li>JavaScript - <a href="https://standardjs.com/">Standard</a></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="pull-requests">Pull requests</h2>

<p>When we have finished a piece of work on a branch, we
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/">make a pull request</a>
using the project’s GitHub/GitLab page.</p>

<p>We prefix pull request titles with the Story ID to make it easy to find the
story and the acceptance criteria that should be met.</p>

<p>A good pull request should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be created by the authoring developer</li>
  <li>meet all of the acceptance criteria on the associated story</li>
  <li>focus on the single problem at hand, not doing so will usually increase the
time taken to get it merged</li>
  <li>include appropriate detail to assist the reviewer, this includes links to
relevant content and a duplication of anything of note in the commit
descriptions</li>
  <li>update the <a href="#tracking-changes">changelog</a> if it’s a significant change</li>
</ul>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># Poor

<h2 id="versioning-releases">Versioning releases</h2>

<p>We don’t use explicit versioning for application code; rather we operate a
continuous deployment approach as described in the <a href="#deploying">deploying</a>
section.</p>

<p>However, when building libraries, APIs, or other software components designed
for reuse, versioning is important. All reusable components should have properly
versioned releases. This includes Wordpress plugins and themes, Ruby gems, and
so on, whether open source or otherwise.</p>

<p>Versioning should follow the <a href="https://semver.org">Semantic Versioning</a> standard,
and projects that use them should specify their requirements so that the
appropriate versions are used.</p>

<p>Releases should be created by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>updating the version appropriately in package metadata and committing to git</li>
  <li>updating the <a href="#tracking-changes">changelog</a> to draw a line under changes and
attribute them to a version</li>
  <li>tagging that commit using a tag of the form <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vX.Y.Z</code></li>
  <li>building the appropriate release package from that tag</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="tracking-changes">Tracking changes</h2>

<p>If a project is not continuously released, and has staged releases, we want to
track what goes into those releases, so we can be confident about what we’re
shipping, know when we shipped it, and share what we’ve done with our clients
(and maybe beyond).</p>

<p>Including a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CHANGELOG.md</code> file in the root of a repository is a standard for
tracking these changes against versions, but the only work if they are updated.
When introducing a significant change to a project, we should be recording that
change at the time we make it, while the issue is fresh in our minds.</p>

<p>We follow the <a href="https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/">Keep a Changelog 1.0.0</a>
format for the changelogs we keep. This means integrating updating the changelog
into the release process for the project. This also means
<a href="#versioning-releases">versioning</a> the project.</p>

<p>If the team decides that a changelog is not appropriate for a project, you
should document that decision as an
<a href="https://adr.github.io/">Architectural Decision Record (ADR)</a>, so future
maintainers and contributors understand the reasoning for not doing so.</p>

<p>See
<a href="https://github.com/dxw/tech-team-rfcs/blob/master/rfc-019-use-changelogs-to-track-changes.md">Tech Team RFC-019</a>
