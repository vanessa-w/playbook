  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Add a note to the timeline, mentioning the method - e.g. 2014-01-02:
    Reported to vendor by email</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />At the bottom of the page, set the status to “Reported”</li>
</ul>

<p>As an example of a humanising intro:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hello We’ve found a security vulnerability in Version 2.8.2 of the Advanced
Access Manager plugin – please see the details below. After you’ve had a
chance to investigate could you please let us know a timeline for a fix – our
disclosure policy is linked at the bottom of the report. Best regards Duncan</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="notify-the-wordpress-plugin-admins">Notify the WordPress plugin admins</h2>

<p>There are two scenarios in which the WordPress plugin admins
(plugins@wordpress.org) should be contacted:</p>

<ol>
  <li>If we really couldn’t get in touch with the plugin dev</li>
  <li>If the vulnerability is really serious and the plugin is popular (say over
100,000 downloads), so needs to be taken down ASAP</li>
</ol>

<p>Their policy is this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every attempt to contact the developer directly should be made BEFORE you
reported the plugin to us. Since our policy is to close the plugin (preventing
new downloads) until it’s fixed, you may not be alerted until the plugin is
updated.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="task-list">
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Hit the “WP Plugins” button under “Report emails”</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Add a note to the timeline - e.g. 2014-01-02: Reported to WP Plugins</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="rotating_light-important-rotating_light">:rotating_light: IMPORTANT :rotating_light:</h3>

<p>If we couldn’t get in touch with the plugin author then WP Org may be able to
contact them on our behalf, BUT we shouldn’t expect them to feed back any
information to us, or even to confirm that they have successfully contacted the
author (they are insanely busy).</p>

<p>Therefore we shouldn’t say things like “No response from WP Org” (because we
shouldn’t expect one) or “No response from author to WP Org” (because we don’t
know that’s the case).</p>

<h2 id="publishing-an-advisory">Publishing an Advisory</h2>

<p>There are two reasons that we will publish an advisory:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The plugin author lets us know that they’ve fixed the issue and released a fix</li>
  <li>We couldn’t contact the plugin author, or they didn’t respond within the time
period defined in our
<a href="https://security.dxw.com/disclosure/">disclosure policy</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If an author has at any point been in touch and shown willingness to cooperate
then we should give them the benefit of the doubt and make several attempts to
get in touch.</p>

<h3 id="preparing-advisories-for-publication">Preparing advisories for publication</h3>

<p>If the issue is fixed:</p>

<ul class="task-list">
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Ensure that there’s a note in the timeline of when the vendor first
    replied.</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Update the timeline as appropriate, e.g. 2014-01-02: Vendor reported issue
    fixed in version 1.2.3</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Update the timeline as appropriate, e.g. 2014-01-05: Advisory published</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Mark the advisory from ‘Reported’ to ‘Fixed’</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Update the ‘mitigation’ section to say ‘Upgrade to version X or later’</li>
</ul>

<p>If the issue is NOT fixed:</p>

<ul class="task-list">
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Update the timeline as appropriate, e.g. 2014-01-02: Vendor could not be
    contacted</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Update the timeline as appropriate, e.g. 2014-01-05: Published</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Leave the status as ‘Reported’</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Update the ‘mitigation’ section to say ‘Disable: the plugin has been
    removed from the plugins directory and no fixed version is known.’</li>
</ul>

<p>If the plugin was removed from the directory:</p>

<ul class="task-list">
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Update the timeline as appropriate, e.g. 2014-01-02: Plugin has been
    removed from the WordPress directory</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Update the timeline as appropriate, e.g. 2014-01-05: Published</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Leave the status as ‘Reported’</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Update the ‘mitigation’ section to say ‘Disable: no fixed version is
    known.’</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="publishing-the-advisory-and-associated-inspection">Publishing the advisory and associated inspection</h3>

<ul class="task-list">
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Set the Tweet status to ‘Tweet’</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Amend the published date to today (otherwise it will show with the
    privately published date)</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Publish the advisory</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />While logged in, view the published advisory and hit the Full Disclosure,
    WP Scan and dxw WP Security buttons</li>
</ul>

<p>Once the advisory has been published the associated inspection can also be
published:</p>

<ul class="task-list">
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Add a link to the advisory</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Set the Tweet status to ‘Do not tweet’</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Amend the published date to today (otherwise it will show with the
    privately published date)</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Publish the inspection</li>
</ul>

<p>Once it’s published we can alert upstream:</p>

<ul class="task-list">
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Email the developer:
    <ul>
      <li>thank them for the fix</li>
      <li>include a link to the advisory</li>
      <li>suggest that they add the link to the changelog</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="request-a-cve">Request a CVE</h3>

<p>Note that most CVEs cannot be requested before publication due to the rules of
the Distributed Weakness Filing project. Vulnerabilities in plugins made by
WordPress itself follow different rules as they’re covered by MITRE.</p>

<ul class="task-list">
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Visit <a href="https://iwantacve.org">https://iwantacve.org</a> and fill out the form</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Add a note to the timeline - e.g. 2014-01-02: Requested CVE</li>
