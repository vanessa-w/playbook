          <h1>How we do pitches</h1>
          <p>Pitching is an opportunity to demonstrate our expertise, showcase our work and
demonstrate our values. Sometimes, we have plenty of notice and time to prepare,
other times we have to turn pitches around quickly. To give ourselves the best
possible chance, we should follow the steps outlined below.</p>

<h2 id="preparing-in-advance">Preparing in advance</h2>

<p>When we find out we are pitching, the first thing to do is assemble the pitch
team, and make them aware as early as possible of their involvement. The people
pitching should be whoever is lined up to do the work if we’re successful. We
should also nominate someone to lead and coordinate producing the pitch.</p>

<p>When we receive an invitation to a pitch, send a prompt reply back to thank the
buyer for the invitation and give them any information they need (such as names
of attendees).</p>

the dates into the pitch members’ calendars and set reminders in Slack so we are
