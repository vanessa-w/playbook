          <h1>Team changes and handovers</h1>
          <p>Projects inevitably undergo team member changes. This can be for a number of
reasons. If a project has been running for a long time, it is often beneficial
to introduce some new ideas to the team, and to give incumbent team members a
chance to experience, and be challenged by, something different. Alternatively,
the scope of the project might change, requiring a different set of skills to
those provided by the existing team. It’s normal that changes need to happen.
Whatever the reason, it’s critical that we ensure personnel changes and
handovers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>maintain the momentum of the team and the project</li>
  <li>are handled efficiently and with clarity</li>
  <li>are well understood and agreed to by the individual, the client, and the team</li>
  <li>ensure an effective transfer of knowledge</li>
  <li>work well in the context of other ongoing dxw projects</li>
</ul>

<p>The following guidance is intended to outline the standard steps that can be
taken by anyone moving to a new project.</p>

<h4 id="speak-with-your-new-delivery-lead">Speak with your new delivery lead</h4>

<p>Your new delivery lead should arrange a catch up before you start work on the

providing the key details and useful contextual information about the project.
They should also make clear to you what the expectations for you working on the
project are.</p>

yourself with the project.</p>
