theirs. You might get a few chances to work with some individuals who are keen
to learn, but really you’re there to deliver working software. Any capability
building is a side effect.The exit plan in these cases is almost always handing over your service to their
in-house teams. Many organisations in this state will have internal governance
to ensure that handover will be possible. So, as well as adopting their best
practices and technology standards, you’ll be spending some of your time
engaging with the technical governance the client has in place. Hopefully you
can use the things your team is already doing – like architecture decision
records – to do that engagement. Sometimes you’ll need to do extra work.
Sometimes quite a lot of it.This extra work can feel really frustrating when you’re trying to ship a
service, but it’s really important. Just as we wouldn’t take on a service we had
no hand in that doesn’t meet any of our standards, we shouldn’t expect our
clients to. Part of your role is to build relationships with the technology
folks in the client’s organisation, find out which bits of governance we need to
care about, and make sure your team is in a good position to satisfy them. Often
those people you build relationships with will be happy to help if you involve
them early enough!Sometimes the amount of governance we need to go through takes an unexpected
amount of effort, particularly when the drive for governance comes from a
different place to the drive for delivery. We do our best to meet all the
governance needs but when that effort starts to risk delivery, we present those
risks, along with alternatives, to the client. Ultimately, it’s up to them what
risk they’re prepared to carry. We often have to do some amount of mediation in
that case (usually biased towards delivery - it’s what we’re there for after
all).">
